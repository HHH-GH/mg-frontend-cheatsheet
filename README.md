## What
- Print out all the breakpoints and font sizes and widths and spacings and paddings  ✔
- Print out all the named colours used in the design system so they can be copy-pasted ✔
- It’s possibly out of date? Check [colors](https://github.com/MetaFam/TheGame/tree/develop/packages/design-system/src/theme/colors.ts), [breakpoints](https://github.com/MetaFam/TheGame/blob/0a32ee9f2fe957ac64aec5ff937a898defd8abd6/packages/design-system/src/theme/index.ts#L168), [font-sizes](https://github.com/MetaFam/TheGame/blob/0a32ee9f2fe957ac64aec5ff937a898defd8abd6/packages/design-system/src/theme/index.ts#L393C17) for updates.
